# Discord AttachBot v1.0
Automates attachment control with scheduled block/unblock, role bypass, logs, and manual overrides. Keep your server safe and organized effortlessly.

# What does this bot do?

This bot blocks attachment sending in all server channels for a specific role at a specific time, then automatically unblocks permission at the specified time. You can ban roles, ban channels, set moderators to edit the bot, and much more! You can also manually block attachment sending with one command and unblock them with another. Logs are also available (optional).
